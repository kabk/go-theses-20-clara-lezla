				<span class="italic">What is the un-childish nature of fairy tales?
The valuable essences of fairy tales against prejudices of adulthood</span>
<br>“There is no such thing as the Fairy tale. There are Fairy tales. When we see them we know them; we sense that they are. I congratulate writers for bringing our ageless anxieties and hopes once more to light through the hypnotic and clinical lens that is fairy tales”. Jack Zipes<br>
When you look up the definition of fairy tale you will find many descriptions and definitions, vague and wrong, all opinionated. The truth is that fairy tales are hard to put in a box, they have existed for centuries and have taken thousands of different forms. They have this thing, this aura that allows them to be told repeatedly for generations. Magic polymorphic, any teller can make them his own. To me, it is enough to be fascinated by them…. But I am an adult now, and adults are not sensitive to fairy tales in general, because they think they’re “not meant for them” . As I grew up, I have trouble sharing my interests.
I’m misunderstood. «I knew it, of course, she loves fairies and elves because she wears pink lol». I am not taken seriously. «Clara, fairy tales are not serious matter, they are for children.» I can read their eyes.  Well, are they really? I don’t know if people would read the story of Little Red Riding Hood to their offspring if they knew that the little girl is proposed to “sleep” with the wolf, eat her granny, drink her blood…which happens to be the first version of the story! Fairy tales bring hope, imagination, moral and self-reflection, but also show misogynistic behavior, gender discrimination and child abuse. They are insightful yet terrific. Are they really for children then? Or are they for adults? What makes them childish and why do I think they’re not? I was told that life is not a fairy tale. I’ll show you reader,
that in fact, it is.

				When I was still very young, my mum passed me a book that she received when she was a young scholar : «Vassilissa- the-Wise, Russian fairy tales». I always read it during my Christmas vacations. The book’s big and heavy with a green cover, showing the characters of the different stories all together. It is composed of eight stories, being the classic of Russian Tales. There’s one large watercolor illustration per story, As well as  a small black and white drawing, like an engraved stamp, at the beginning and the end of each text. I hadn’t fully realized it until now that the tales were Russian even if I knew it. I just knew I liked to read «Tsar» instead of «King», and those incredible and unusual names such as «Sirka Bourka», «Nikita », « Matioucha the ash man». I prefer these stories because they were drier and weird, embraced more violence than others. I found that protagonist’s were brutal and harsh to each other and dare I say… I liked it. I had a morbid curiosity for those gruesome passages and the one I remember till this days when a young man had to cut off a piece of his calf to give to the «Eagle » that saved him. Talking about eagles, it along with the Fire Horse, are two animals that often reappear in Russian Tales; way more exciting than the western wood wolf. That’s just my point of view… But it did not prevent me from enjoying those other stories.
My grand-mother was reading me fairy tales from a book she had (the cover’s not really interesting). At that time, I never tried to know who was the author, as if the stories were existing by themselves. Now I can identify that there were different authors, the unavoidable Charles Perrault, Christian Andersen, and off course the famous Brothers Grimm. She was not reading at night to make me fall asleep but during those days of heavy rain, because there was nothing else to do. She was living in the south of France, and we were visiting her only during the summer vacations. Needless to say, rainy days are quite infrequent in the middle of July on the mediterranean coast, so those reading moments were quite rare. We would go into her little office where she was keeping the few photos of her when she was young, her papers, the shell box (box where my brother and I would put the most beautiful shells we found during our daily “beach mornings”) and of course the books filled with fairy tales. The weather was forcing everyone to stay at home and strangely, I felt cut off from the rest of the world…
The rest of the year, I devoured any novel that fell into my hands, including the «Red Tales of the perched Cat» by Marcel Aymé. Those stories were devoid of any magical aspect although still making farm animals talk and creating bizarre, whimsical events. They also described the traditional rural French way of life; which seemed as unreal as any other Middle Age like it. It started like so : “I sat under an apple tree and the cat told me adventures that only he knew about. He knew them because they happened to the animals of the neighborhood and to his friends: the two little girls Marinette and Delphine. Those tales of the perched cat, I give them here (in this book) without changing anything. The opinion of my friend the cat is that they are suitable for all children who are still old enough to understand animals and talk with them.”…

As everyone of my generation (the unique millennials) I also grew up with the animated fairy tales of Walt Disney; Alice in Wonderland, The Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Mulan. Some of those tales are extremely old, some are from different cultures, some hold roots in real historical events. Whichever, at the end they all seemed to come from the same person. Some of those stories were also in my grand-mother’s books, but I was asking her to skip them when she was reading, so the Disney version is the only one I know. I don’t think it was clear to me exactly what I was reading and what I was watching, were both fairy tales. If you look up the definition of fairy tale you will find many descriptions and definitions, incorrect and vague, all opinionated. The truth is that fairy tales are hard to put in a box, they have continued to exist for centuries and have taken thousands of different forms. Jack Zipes point of view is a case in point :  <span class="italic">“There is no such a thing as The Fairy tales. There are Fairy tales. When we see them we know them; we sense that they are. I congratulate writers for bringing our ageless anxieties and hopes once more to light through the hypnotic and clinical lens that is fairy tales”</span>.  <span class="italic">Jack Zipes</span>. <a class="bookmarklink" href="#bookmark1" id="link1">[1]</a> They have this thing, this aura that allows them to be told over and over again, generation after generation. Magic polymorphic, any teller can make them his own. To me, it is enough to be fascinated by them….

But I am an adult now, and adults are not sensitive to fairy tales in general, because they think they’re “not meant for them” . As I grew up, I’ve had trouble  sharing  my interests.
I ‘m misunderstood.  “I knew it, of course, she loves fairies and elf because she wears pink lol”. I’m not taken seriously.
“Clara, fairy tales are not serious matter, they are for children.”
I can read in their eyes. Well, are they really? I don’t know if people would read the Red Riding Hood to their offspring if they knew that the little girl is proposed to “sleep” with the wolf, eat her granny, drink her blood, and yet that was the first version of the story. Fairy tales bring hope, imagination, moral and self reflection, but also show misogynistic behavior, gender discrimination,and child abuse. They are amazing and horrible. Is it really for children then? Or for adults? What makes them seem childish and why do I think they’re not? If I was told that life is not a fairy tale. I will show you reader, that in fact, it is...

				<span class="italic">“Fairy tales begin with conflict because we all begin our lives with conflict. We are all misfit for the world, and somehow we must fit in, fit with other people, and thus we must invent or find the means through communication to satisfy as well as resolve conflicting desires and instincts.”</span>
				Wonder tales and folktales are the stories of the people, for the people and  by the people: in the Middle Ages, peasants, travelers, mendiants, soldiers, merchants, everyone was telling each other stories. Told during field work, dinners or community gatherings, they were also spread to the upper class by way of the lower class people who were working as nurses, maidens, etc. The stories showed a desire to celebrate the community, to escape from the rude reality of life, to dream about a better conditions. Each peasant community transformed and added something on the tales as they spread. Children were never excluded from the audience no matter how violent or erotic the stories were6. It continued like this up until the 17th century when, in French salons, aristocrats, at first women, used peasant oral tales and folk tales as a source of inspiration. They could see the emancipatory potential of the narrations to write their own stories for the upper class.
It was a new type of tale: fairy tales. They were called this because the authors were putting emphasis on the fairies in the plot, introducing a new type of character...
 <span class="italic">“Flying fatty, jealous sexy pinup, or sparkling mignonne, the fairies had changed forms but their magic stayed strong... Your guardian angel, a true genuine helper, not an angel in the house but a watch(wo)man...The Fairy”</span>
 formula in order to create their imagery. Grand pictures of amazing magnitude were created in God’s name. Be it a homage to the Divine or just an outright exposition of skill, their grip was unquestionable.<br><br>


Pixies, boggarts, brownies, greenies, knockers, lobs, hobs, lubberkins, and others, fairies have many names. The believe in these spirits have existed for millennium and differ from one culture to another. They are magical beings that can’t be
placed into to any human gender distinction. But, in the past two centuries, encouraged by those new types of stories, fairies
have lost their ambiguous shape and started to be represented with the female gender. The first time the term «fairy tale» has been employed by the interesting Madame D’Aulnoy, in 1690 in her story: “The Isle of Happiness”. She was the first one to introduce the female caretaker fairy character, and those
stories were such a trend that the term “Fairy Tales” took over the term “Folk tales” <a class="bookmarklink" href="#bookmark2" id="link2">[2]</a>. Madame D’Aulnoy was a lady, and as so many ladies in the late 17th century, she did not have the
opportunity to speak up in many ways. The only hobby allowed for a woman of her standing was to use the salon and precisely
«the boudoir» (french private cafe where artists and authors would meet to talk and drink absinthe) to recite, tell and read her invented stories. It is important to realize that those places were the only place where women could demonstrate their skills, having only a few privileges in public.
